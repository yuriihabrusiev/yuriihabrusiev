## Daily Drivers
For (almost) everything I use [iPhone 13 mini](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111873) with [AirPods Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111851) and [Apple Watch Series 6](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111918). 
<br>
Also I have [iPad mini 6](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111886) for reading, sketching and gaming. 

To stay productive and organized, I rely on the default (and free!) Calendar, Reminders, and Notes apps.

For secure password and passkey management and sharing, I use [1Password](https://1password.com).

## Workspace
My “workstation” is [MacBook Air \(15-inch, M2, 2023\)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111346).
<br>
For more intensive development tasks I use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) theme and [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) font. 
<br>
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is my invaluable coding buddy. 
<br>
In terminal I use `zsh` with [Starship](https://starship.rs) prompt.
